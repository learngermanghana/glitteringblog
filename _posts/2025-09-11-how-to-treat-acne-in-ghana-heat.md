Managing **acne in Ghana's heat** can feel frustrating, especially when sweat, sunscreen, and pollution combine during the day. The good news is that acne can improve with a structured routine.

## Step 1: Keep cleansing simple

Wash your face morning and evening with a gentle gel cleanser. Over-washing increases irritation and may worsen breakouts.

## Step 2: Use proven acne ingredients

Choose one active ingredient at a time:

- **Salicylic acid (BHA):** helps unclog pores
- **Benzoyl peroxide:** targets acne-causing bacteria
- **Adapalene:** supports long-term acne control

Start slowly (2-3 nights weekly) and increase as tolerated.

## Step 3: Moisturize even if skin is oily

Oily skin still needs hydration. Use an oil-free, non-comedogenic moisturizer to protect your skin barrier.

## Step 4: Never skip sunscreen

UV exposure can darken acne marks. Use SPF 30+ every day to prevent post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation from getting worse.

## Step 5: Reduce habits that trigger breakouts

- Change pillowcases often.
- Clean phone screens regularly.
- Avoid heavy pomades around your hairline.
- Shower after workouts.

## How long before results?

Most acne routines need **8-12 weeks** of consistency. Quick switching between products often delays progress.

## When to see a dermatologist in Ghana

Book a professional review if you have:

- Painful cystic acne
- Deep scars
- Severe dark marks affecting confidence
- No improvement after 3 months

## Final thoughts

Acne treatment is a long game. Focus on consistency, gentle care, and sun protection to clear active breakouts and reduce marks over time.
