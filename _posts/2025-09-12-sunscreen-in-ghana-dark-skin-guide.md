Many people still ask, "Do I need sunscreen if I have dark skin?" The answer is yes. If you want to prevent hyperpigmentation, uneven tone, and premature aging, **daily sunscreen in Ghana is essential**.

## Why sunscreen matters in Ghana

High UV exposure can worsen:

- Dark spots
- Melasma
- Acne marks
- Fine lines and skin texture changes

## What to look for in a sunscreen

1. **Broad-spectrum SPF 30 or SPF 50**
2. **PA+++ or higher** for UVA protection
3. **No white cast formula** (often tinted or modern chemical filters)
4. **Sweat-resistant** option for outdoor work

## How much sunscreen should you apply?

Use the two-finger rule for face and neck. Reapply every 2-3 hours in direct sun.

## Best sunscreen routine order

Morning order:

1. Cleanser
2. Moisturizer
3. Sunscreen (last skincare step)
4. Makeup (optional)

## Common sunscreen mistakes

- Applying too little product
- Applying once in the morning and never reapplying
- Skipping sunscreen on cloudy days
- Ignoring ears, neck, and hands

## Final thoughts

The best sunscreen is the one you can wear daily without irritation or white cast. Consistent use will visibly improve tone clarity and protect your skin long term.
